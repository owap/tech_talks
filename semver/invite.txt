Join us on Friday, May 22 for our next OpenWhere Tech Talk: Semantic Versioning
and Cutting Releases. In this talk, we'll cover the following topics:

+ What is Semantic Versioning?
+ Why is Semantic Versioning useful, especially re: our growing customer base?
+ How do we use it? (Cutting Releases)

The second and third topics will lead us nicely into a discussion on how we can
begin versioning (and cutting releases of) our software -- an especially
important topic with the advent of "Configurator," OpenWhere core products, and
our multiple commercial customers.

As of right now, this talk is "bring your own lunch," but I will send out
notifications if this changes.

We've allocated an hour for this tech talk, so please bring your opinions and 
previous victories re: versioning and release-cutting to share with the team. 
This discussion will inform company culture/policy going forward!

Thank you, and I look forward to seeing everybody's smiling faces next Friday!
