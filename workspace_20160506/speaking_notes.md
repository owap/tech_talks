# Workspaces
Let's talk about the new office.
I know there's been some concern about the place, especially around seating arrangements.
I can take the blame for some of those concerns.

# Offices
But an office is more than just a place to sit and work.
It's the place where we:

+ spend a third (or more) of our lives,
+ grow professionally, and
+ develop relationships

# Potential
I think we have an opportunity here to think about and discuss the potential for what our workspace could become.
We didn't get to choose the location, but we do get choose

# Our Space

[NOtes]

Assume that people have walked through the office
Assume offices and cubes are off limit (talk about what's in scope)
Pit, dev, kitchen.

Want the dev team to have a say in how we configure the workspace, but here are the boundaries


  + how we want to use the space, and
  + our attitudes towards it.

This is our chance to start from scratch and build a culture around the way we want to work.
+ How we want to spend our lives
+ How we want to grow professionally
+ How we want to develop our working relationships

# Three Questions
With that in mind, I think there are three questions we can answer to kick-start our new corporate culture:

+ What do you need to feel:
    - Productive,
    - Happy, and
    - Valued?

# Wish List
We're going to use these questions to build a wish list
Of things we want that will help us own the space

# Process
For each topic, you'll have 2 minutes to write down ideas
After two minutes, we'll go around the room and read off one idea per person
We'll capture the idea, and get a tally of people who agree with it
We'll keep going around the room until people are out of ideas to share, and then we'll move on to the next question

We're not going to throw out or veto any ideas, we're just going to capture them

# Concerns
Some things people need to feel productive will be things that will make others feel unproductive.

For each item in our "Positives" list, we'll also collect a tally of people who view the item not-positively

Then we'll go around and capture any additional concerns with the space.

But let's please save our concerns for the end.

# Goal
After this exercise, we'll have a prioritized list of things we need to make us

+ Productive
+ Happy, and
+ Valued,

...as well as our weighted list of things we feel would get in the way of achieving our goal of building an awesome workspace.

# OK
Let's start building our list of things to create our ideal workspace!

# Think About
+ Cost Savings
+ Way better than other options

[Cheat codes]
+ Where do we put the white boards and how many do we need?
+ Information radiators -- build status monitors
+ How do we want to organize?
+ How flexible do we want the seating arrangemnets to be?
    - silos are a concern
    - cliques are bad
    - want effective collaboration across different teams.

+ Take the wish list seriously, but manage expectations!!

+ TIE IT TO REVENUE GOALS
    - if we do $10M this year, we can get X in the office

+ Other ways to spend mone
    - Conference fees?
    - Open-sourcue development picked up by OpenWhere?
    - Recruiting development
