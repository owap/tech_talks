# Workspaces
Let's talk about the new office.
I know there's been some concern about the place, especially around seating arrangements.
I can take the blame for some of those concerns.

# Offices
But an office is more than just a place to sit and work.
It's the place where we:

+ spend a third (or more) of our lives,
+ grow professionally, and
+ develop relationships

# Potential
I think we have an opportunity here to think about and discuss the potential for what our workspace could be.
We didn't get to choose the location, but we do get choose 

  + how we want to use the space, and
  + our attiudes towards it.
