# Workspaces
Let's talk about the new office.
I know there's been some concern about the place, especially around seating arrangements.
I can take the blame for some of those concerns.

# Offices
But an office is more than just a place to sit and work.
It's the place where we:

+ spend a third (or more) of our lives,
+ grow professionally, and
+ develop relationships

# Potential
I think we have an opportunity here to think about and discuss the potential for what our workspace could become.
We didn't get to choose the location, but we do get choose

# Our Space
  + how we want to use the space, and
  + our attitudes towards it.

This is our chance to start from scratch and build a culture around the way we want to work.
+ How we want to spend our lives
+ How we want to grow professionally
+ How we want to develop our working relationships

# Three Questions
With that in mind, I think there are three questions we can answer to kick-start our new corporate culture:

+ What do you need to feel:
    - Productive,
    - Happy, and
    - Valued?

# Wish List
We're going to use these questions to build a wish list
Of things we want that will help us own the space

# Process
For each topic, you'll have 2 minutes to write down ideas
After two minutes, we'll go around the room one at a time and read off ONE idea
We'll capture the idea, and we'll get a tally of people who agree with it
We'll keep going around the room until people are out of ideas to share, and then we'll move on to the next question

We're not going to throw out or veto any ideas, we're just going to capture them

# Concerns
Some things people need to feel productive will be things that you feel make you unproductive.
If there are concerns after this exercise, we will capture these at the end of our discussion.

For each item in our "Positives" list, we'll also collect a tally of people who view the item not-positively
Then we'll go around and capture any additional concerns with the space.

# Goal
After this exercise, we'll have a prioritized list of things we need to make us

+ Productive
+ Happy, and
+ Valued,

...as well as a prioritized list of things we feel would get in the way of achieving our goal of building an awesome workspace.
